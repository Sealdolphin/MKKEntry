Entry:
  has unique ID: String? (Barcode)
  has a name (optional)
  has an entryStatus (isEntered or not)
  has a ticket-type (got at entry, or based)
  
EntryController:
  Handles the default Commands.
  Commands can be updated! (Changed by hand, also can scan code)* GUI helps with that
  Handles entry and entry database
  DB is a List of Entries.. can be updated from file, also can be exported
  
  
  
Commands are specific ID-s (barcodes)
  READ_CODE = "": reads the code, and if its in the database, enters the guest
  ENTRY_FULL = "": enters the guest (custom id generated afterwards, also counts as READ_CODE) with a full-prize ticket
  
  LEAVE = "": changes guest status to left (code read afterwards)
  DISCOUNT_TYPE_1 = "": changes the ticket price with the discount (CODE READ BEFOREHAND!!)
  DISCOUNT_TYPE_2 = "": changes the ticket price with the discount...
  
How it works:
SCENARIO 1 (Online purchase)
  1: Guest purchases a ticket online
  2: We register purchase to the database
  3: Guest receives a custom ticket / purchase ID
  3b: in case the guest has more tickets, than receives multiple different IDs
  4: Guest enters the gate gets his ticket scanned...?
  5: Program updates guest status (Entered, if was not, error/warning otherwise)
  
SCENARIO 2 (Offline purchase)
  1: Guest enters the gate
  2: We scan a default price ticket - it generates a custom ID
  3: If Guest has access to discount, we grant them
